    * Update from source: Drag drop HDR files; some CSS fixes
    
    * Prompt for HDR drag drop
    
    * Space Opera: preserve any non-object URLs for src and HDRs for convenience
    
    * Do not change current model if snippet src could not be fetched

    * Add button to revert base color factor to original
    
    * Boilerplate for reverting all other material edits; formatting is way off though;
    
    * Update styles for revert button
